## Description of my Filter Lists

### List: `blocklists`

A collection of all block lists that I use.

### List: `crunchyroll`

This was a trial to archive chrunchyroll adblocking on my Android TV. At the end it worked sometimes, but mostly not.

### List: `other.txt`

All "bad" Websites that I have found and that were not listed in one of the lists at "blocklists"

### List: `smarthomecompanys`

Block the communication to yeelight, magichue and tuya (smartlife) clouds. I am using these lists, as I can control these smart home devices locally via HomeAssistant.

### List: `whitelist`

All websites that I think shouldn't be blocked, but get blocked by some of my used lists.
